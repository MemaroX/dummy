# dummy: A Foundational AI Assistant Project

This repository serves as a foundational project for developing an AI assistant, embodying principles of modularity, extensibility, and clean code. While currently a placeholder, it's designed to be the starting point for a sophisticated AI system, following a "Tony Stark"-inspired methodology of iterative development and advanced capabilities.

## Project Vision

The "dummy" project aims to evolve into a robust AI assistant capable of:
- Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
- Task Automation
- Data Analysis and Insights
- Proactive Assistance
- Integration with various systems

## Project Structure

- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and vision for the project.
- `LICENSE`: The MIT License under which this project is distributed.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists core dependencies for the project.
- `core/`: (Planned) Directory for core AI functionalities (e.g., NLU, task management).
- `modules/`: (Planned) Directory for extensible modules (e.g., weather, news, system control).
- `utils/`: (Planned) Directory for utility functions and helper scripts.

## Getting Started
